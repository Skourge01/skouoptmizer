deep optimization script for archlinux

## what it does
the script uses as a base [information from ARU](https://github.com/ventureoo/ARU)
- it uses some optimizations that it makes available for archlinux
which are
- [ananicy](https://github.com/Skourge01/skouoptmizer/wiki/Ananicy%E2%80%90cpp)
- [glvariables](https://github.com/Skourge01/skouoptmizer/wiki/glvariables)
- graphicaldepencences
- initramfs_lz4
- multilib
- pipewire
- reflector + rsync (discontinued)
- stereo_mix_51
- systemd_initramfs
- trim
## Another warning:
- everything listed will be activated with y/n and a check, so it is up to the user to decide whether to activate it or not
- I recommend that you see what each optimization does before wanting to activate them (check the source code for this)

## for debian
- still in development but most of the optimizations I'm doing
### Activation rules
```
warning: I'm not responsible for optimizations that were poorly replicated on systems that are not approved by me
warning: I'm not responsible for optimizations that were poorly replicated through unstable commits (new commits are in testing phase, so the one that has (testing) then this rule already applies
warning: check the approved distros
```
## Workflow recommendations
- linux-zen (native)
- linux (unlikely)
- linux-lts (unlikely)
- zram (tested)
- swapfile (unlikely)
## Approved and supported distros
arch (native)
debian (unlikely)
## Optimization information:
check: https://ventureo.codeberg.page/source/services.html

## Low RAM? - use zram or swapfile for best performance
